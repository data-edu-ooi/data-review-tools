"Statistics were not calculated for dissolved oxygen data downloaded from the OOI system due to observed differences between platform and shipboard CTD cast dissolved oxygen, as well as concerns of data quality degradation over time from biofouling and sensor drift. Further analysis is required to correct dissolved oxygen using the shipboard bottle data, but this is outside the scope of this project."
