CE06ISSM-RID16-03-DOSTAD000,comment,,,,Leila,2018-12-19T17:15:00,"Deployments 1, 4, and 6: The missing data in the  recovered_inst stream are found at the end of the record in both the telemetered and recovered_host streams.

Deployments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7: The timestamps do not match exactly when comparing streams of different methods. Overlapping the data in a plot will hardly show the difference.

Deployments 2, 4, 6, and 8: Invalid data represent data outside global ranges [0 - 400 µmol/Kg] : There are values greater than 400 and less than 0 in the data.

Deployments 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7: Invalid data represent data well above the maximum global ranges 400 µmol/(L,Kg) for dissolved oxygen concentrations or 110 % for oxygen saturation. Biofouling and DO sensor drift are both observed in the data.

CE06ISSM-RID16-03-DOSTAD000,comment,8,,,Leila,2018-12-19T17:10:00,"Why are recovered-inst data not in the system?

The missing data in the  recovered_host stream are found at the end of the record in the telemetered stream.

Is the instrument depth in asset managment wrong? The data are showing that it is 1 dbar deeper than what is entered in asset management.

From previous notes, the gap in the data is due to batteries not recharging sufficiently. To conserve power, the MFN was turned off and the NSIF was reduced to 1 hour communications. The OPTAA is the only instrument on the MFN without internal batteries. See redmine ticket #12980 .",
