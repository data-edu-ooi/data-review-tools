comment,CE02SHBP-LJ01D-08-OPTAAD106,,,,Lori,2019-10-03T16:15:00,,"According to Roesler and Barnard (Optical proxy for phytoplankton biomass in the absence of photophysiology: Rethinking the absorption line height, Methods in Oceanography, 2013), “absorption meters are highly prone to biofouling, particularly biofilms which not only attenuate the collimated beam but also impact the scattering properties of the optical surfaces and tubes. In productive coastal waters biofouling can have significant impacts (i.e. 10% of the signal) within one to two weeks”. "

comment,RS03INT1-MJ03C-09-THSPHA301,,,,Lori,2019-10-17T13:22:00,,The system is unable to process data after 2015 (annotation ID 1421). When this is fixed the annotation should be updated.
