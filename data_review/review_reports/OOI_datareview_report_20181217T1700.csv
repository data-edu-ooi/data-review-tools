Based on the Asset Management deployment depth, the recovered_host and telemetered data are more reasonable than the values from recovered_inst. Salinity and density are also offset between the delivery methods."

Deployments 1, 4, 6, and 8: The missing data in the  preferred stream are found at the end of the record.

Deployments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7: The timestamps do not match exactly and overlapping the data in a plot will hardly show the difference.

Deployments 2, 4, 6, and 8: Invalid data represent often data outside global ranges [0 - 400 µmol/L] and [0 - 400 µmol/Kg]: There are values greater than 400 and less than 0 in the data.

For dissolved oxygen concentrations corrected for temperature and salinity (µmol/L), the maximum global range value should be changed to a value greater than 400 µmol/L."
