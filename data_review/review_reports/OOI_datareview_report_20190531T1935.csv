For example, zoomed in plots from 11/12/2014 - 11/14/2014 show what looks to be a time lag in the dissolved oxygen data? The glider not going to the surface shows up in the overall deployment 1 graph as a band around 50 dbar.

The deployment 4 overall graph has a similar banding feature around 5 dbar. Zoomed in plots from 10/1/2017 - 10/3/2017 depicts very high DO concentrations at the surface on the first downcast. The corresponding temperature data from the CTD has a lower temperature value at the very beginning of each downcast (easily seen in the profile and xsection plots attached).

Similar features are seen in other deployments of other gliders, but these were the most pronounced examples I have seen so far. Some possible issues could be a time lag, biofouling, sensor failure, etc."

Example attached of several segments with consecutive down and up casts for CP05MOAS-GL335-04-DOSTAM000 on 10/26/2015 showing a typical measurement time lag. Profiles should be analyzed for individual time lags and data should be adjusted. OOI doesn't necessarily need to make the adjustment but users should be aware of the issue.

comment,RS03ASHS-MJ03B-07-TMPSFA301,,,,Lori,2019-05-31T14:11:00,,"The position of each thermistor in the 3D array is available in the provenance.json file as a calibration coefficient (e.g., CC_t15_position). While the information is available, it would be more convenient for the user if the positions are given as variable attributes in the netcdf files."

Example attached of several segments with consecutive down and up casts for CP05MOAS-GL335-04-DOSTAM000 on 10/26/2015 showing a typical measurement time lag. Profiles should be analyzed for individual time lags and data should be adjusted. OOI doesn't necessarily need to make the adjustment but users should be aware of the issue.
